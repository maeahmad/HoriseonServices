# Horiseon Services Website
In this Challenge, I will refactor an existing site by modifying its HTML files to make it more accessible. 

## Instructions

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards, SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines. 

## Acceptance Criteria

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
